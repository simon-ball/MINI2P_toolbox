Welcome to the MINI2P_toolbox documentation!

Please find some helpful user tips and additional information in the following pages:

* [Requirements](requirements.md): Non-optical requirements for the mini2p system, both hardware and software
* [Software/AnimalTracker.vi](AnimalTracker.vi.md): How-to for the AnimalTracker LabView application
* [DeepLabCut Models](DeepLabCut-trained-Models.md): Details about the trained DLC models
* [Analysis/DistortionCleaner](DistortionCleaner.mlapp.md): an application to elimiate the scanning distortion of MINI2P imaging, callibrate FOV and pixel size, and generate transform matrix.
* [Analysis/NATEX](NATEX.mlapp.md): Neuronal Activity Tracking Explorer, an application to load, process and preview the neuronal activity data (from the Suite2P output) and the tracking data (from the DLC output)
* [Analysis/StitchingChecker](StitchingChecker.mlapp.md): : an application to stitch multiple FOV recorded from different positions of the cortex.
